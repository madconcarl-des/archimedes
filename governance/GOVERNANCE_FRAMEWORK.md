# Governance Framework for the Archimedes Project

## Executive Summary

The Archimedes Platform operates at the intersection of critical global interests: economic stability, financial crime prevention, data privacy, and national sovereignty. This governance framework establishes the principles, structures, and processes necessary to ensure the platform is developed and operated responsibly, ethically, and in accordance with international law.
