## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Is this really achievable?**

**Q: Can I use this for my own project?**
A: Absolutely! The architecture and code are designed to be adaptable. Start with the POC and scale as needed.

**Q: Who should lead this?**
A: An international consortium (GEIC) with representation from governments, international organizations, and the private sector.

**Q: What's the biggest risk?**
A: Not technical, but geopolitical. Data sovereignty concerns and political will are the main challenges.

**Q: How much does the POC cost to run?**
A: ~$160/month in cloud costs. The POC is designed to be affordable for evaluation purposes.

**Q: Is the code production-ready?**
A: The POC demonstrates core concepts. Production deployment requires additional security hardening, compliance validation, and scale testing.
