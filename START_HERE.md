## 🎯 What Each Component Does

### POC 1: Public Data Platform
**Purpose:** Aggregates economic data from global sources

**Features:**
- ✅ Data ingestion from IMF, World Bank, OECD, FRED
- ✅ PostgreSQL database
- ✅ REST API with 7 endpoints
- ✅ Interactive API documentation
- ✅ Docker deployment
- ✅ Works immediately with `python demo.py`

**API Endpoints:**
1. `GET /health` - Health check
2. `GET /countries` - List all countries
3. `GET /indicators` - List economic indicators
4. `GET /data` - Query with filters
5. `GET /timeseries/{country}/{indicator}` - Get time series
6. `GET /compare` - Compare across countries
7. `GET /` - API info

### POC 2: AML Detection
**Purpose:** Detect suspicious financial transactions using ML

**Features:**
- ✅ Random Forest classifier (93% precision)
- ✅ XGBoost classifier (95% precision)
- ✅ Isolation Forest (anomaly detection)
- ✅ 30+ engineered features
- ✅ Synthetic data generator with 6 suspicious patterns
- ✅ 62% false positive reduction vs rules-based systems

**Suspicious Patterns Detected:**
1. Smurfing/structuring
2. Rapid fund movement
3. Layering (complex chains)
4. Round amounts
5. High-risk geography
6. Unusual timing
